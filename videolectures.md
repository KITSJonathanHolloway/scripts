Five Programming Languages you should know (Larry Wall) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR8fQiskYII
* Javascript (Browser), Java (Industrial), Haskell (Academia), C, Perl (Scripting)

Clean Code Talks
----------------

1. Replacing if with polymorphism - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F72VULWFvc

2. How to write hard to test code - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w
* Mixing the new operator with your business logic
* Global State
* Doing work in the constructor
* Test means -> Isolate (Need a Seam) - Polymorphism
* Leaf methods (Math.abs())
* Deep inheritance
* Too Many Conditionals
* Scenario Tests (Slow, Flakey).  
* Example of testing a car, break car into parts and test independently

Refactoring
-----------

1. Aloha Ruby - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC-pQPq0acs
* Don't ask, Tell - send a message to a class to do something.  Don't ask for internal state and perform some task
* Low Coupling - A and B depend on each other.  If we change B we don't break A.  Makes change easier.
* Grouping behaviour with the data it operates on
* Null Object Pattern
* Depend Upon Abstraction (ActiveRecord instead of SQL).  Abstractions are leaky.
* Shotgun Surgery - opening up 30 files and changing things.  We want to be able to open up one thing and change things
