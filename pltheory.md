# Category Theory

## Basics

Programmers Go Bananas - https://jaortega.wordpress.com/2006/03/17/programmers-go-bananas/
When is a thing equal to a thing - http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf
Meta properties of categories - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_transformation

Everything is based on lists
A list is either:
* Empty List - []
* Head and the rest list - a : list

Lists have recursion built in.

A category consits of a set of O objects with arrows between them
* Associativity - a -> b -> c -> d

Canonical example is a set, but categories go way beyond this in terms of modelling

Two systems are deeply analogous - an isomorphism

An operation that transforms a into b - a -> b 

## Disjoint Categories

Two disjoint catgories: functor maps two categories
* Functor has two functions
* One maps objects of the first to the second
* One puts in correspondance arrows between them (relations)

The functor gives us the ability to see the first one in relation to the second

Can also go meta:
* Can define a category whose *objects are categories* and *arrows which are functors*
