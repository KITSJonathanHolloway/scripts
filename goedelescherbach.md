Bach "The Musical Offering"
###########################

Canon - single theme.  Vary time, pitch, inversion.  
* Three voices - one is free, the other two play.

Fugue  - first starts, then second five notes up/down.  First countersubjects.

Endlessly rising canon.

Translation of the Epimenides paradox - Epimedenes (a cretan) - "All cretans are liars"
* One step strange loop
* Goedels Incompleteness Theorum
* All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions.

Euclid codified geometry
Non Euclidian Geometry - 

Lewis Carroll and math problems:
* What exists in Alice in Wonderland mathematically

Theory of sets - George Cantor (1800's)
* Set of paradoxes here regarding this
* Russells Paradox - mosts sets are not members of themselves
* Grellings Paradox - adjectives. Self descriptive (awkwardnesful) and non (ediable)

The following sentence is false
The following sentence is true

Principia Mathmatica was about exorcising loops logic, set and number theory.
* Lowest type set - only objects
* Higher Type set - objects or sets of the lowest types

Object language
Metalanguage

This analysis on the "sentence statement" deems it meaningless

Meta-mathematics, metalogic.

Russel and Whitehead "Principia Mathmatica" - tried to derive all mathematics from logic.

Hilbert set down a challenge that the system proposed here could be defined as both consistent
and complete.  

Reasoning methods (e.g. finitistic modes)

Goedels paper demolished Hilberts and Principia Mathematica.  It stated that there were
irrepareable holes and that no axiomatic system could produce all number theory truths.

A formal system
Axioms of the system

Look at plane geometry (Euclidian) and the axiomatic base it provides.
