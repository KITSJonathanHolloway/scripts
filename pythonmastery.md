I thought the process of Python mastery went something like:

1. Discover [list comprehensions][1]

2. Discover [generators][2]

3. Incorporate [map, reduce, filter, iter, range, xrange][3] often into your code

4. Discover [Decorators][4]

5. Write recursive functions, a lot

6. Discover [itertools][5] and [functools][6]

7. Read [Real World Haskell][7]

8. Rewrite all your old Python code with tons of higher order functions, recursion, and whatnot.

10. Annoy your cubicle mates every time they present you with a Python class. Claim it could be "better" implemented as a dictionary plus some functions. Embrace functional programming.

11. Rediscover the [Strategy][8] pattern and then [all those things][9] from imperative code you tried so hard to forget after Haskell.

12. Find a balance.
